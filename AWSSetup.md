# AWS IoT Core Setup
In case you already have an AWS account and user created, you can skip steps 1 and 2 and directly go to step 3 (Registering your board with AWS IoT).

## 1 Sign up for an AWS account

1. Open https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup.
2. Follow the online instructions. **NOTE:** Part of the sign-up procedure involves receiving a phone call and entering a verification code on the phone keypad.
3. Make a note of your AWS account number as it will be needed for the following steps.

## 2 Create an Administrator IAM user and grant it permissions

Itâ€™s strongly recommended that you adhere to the best practice of using the `Administrator` IAM user. The following steps show you how to create and securely lock away the root user credentials. One should only sign in as the root user to perform a few [account and service management tasks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/root-vs-iam.html#aws_tasks-that-require-root).

1. Sign in to the [IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/) as the account owner by choosing **Root user** and entering your AWS account email address. On the next page, enter your password.
2. On the navigation bar, click your account name, and then click Account.

8. For **User name**, enter `Administrator`. Select the check box next to **AWS Management Console access**. Then select **Custom password**, and then enter your new password in the text box.
9. (Optional) By default, AWS requires the new user to create a new password when first signing in. You can clear the check box next to **User must create a new password at next sign-in** to allow the new user to reset their password after they sign in.

24. You are now signed in as your **Administrator** IAM user. This IAM user will be used for following steps.

## 3 Registering your board with AWS IoT

Your board must be registered with AWS IoT to communicate with the AWS Cloud. To register your board with AWS IoT, you must have:

* **An AWS IoT policy:** An AWS IoT policy grants your device permissions to access AWS IoT resources. It is stored in the AWS Cloud.
* **An AWS IoT thing:** An AWS IoT thing allows you to manage your devices in AWS IoT. It represents your device and is stored in the AWS Cloud.
* **A private key and X.509 certificate:** A private key and its corresponding public key certificate allow your device to authenticate and communicate securely with AWS IoT.
* **An AWS endpoint:** An AWS endpoint is the URL, or the AWS IoT Core entry point, your devices will connect to.

### 3.1 Creating an AWS IoT policy

1. Go to the [AWS IoT console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iotv2/).
2. In the navigation pane, click **Secure**, then click **Policies** in the drop-down menu.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23126711/165860604-9bc500fe-d1b2-45c8-a997-eb527a0c144c.png)

3. Click **Create Policy**.
4. Enter a name to identify the policy. For this example, the name **DevicePolicy** will be used.

5. Identify your **AWS region** by clicking the location dropdown menu at the top of the page to the left of the account dropdown menu. The **AWS region** is the orange text on the right. For this example, the **AWS region** will be **us-west-2**.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23126711/165860649-05961265-f2a2-4608-a62c-03076bf16506.png)

6. Scroll down to **Policy document** and click the **JSON** button.

7. Inside the **Policy document**, copy and paste the following JSON into the policy editor window. Replace `aws-region` and `aws-account-id` with your AWS Region and Account ID.

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
    {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": "iot:Connect",
        "Resource":"arn:aws:iot:aws-region:aws-account-id:*"
    },
    {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": "iot:Publish",
        "Resource": "arn:aws:iot:aws-region:aws-account-id:*"
    },
    {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": "iot:Subscribe",
         "Resource": "arn:aws:iot:aws-region:aws-account-id:*"
    },
    {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": "iot:Receive",
         "Resource": "arn:aws:iot:aws-region:aws-account-id:*"
    }
    ]
}
```

This policy grants the following permissions:

* **iot:Connect:** Grants your device the permission to connect to the AWS IoT message broker with any client ID.
* **iot:Publish:** Grants your device the permission to publish an MQTT message on any MQTT topic.
* **iot:Subscribe:** Grants your device the permission to subscribe to any MQTT topic filter.
* **iot:Receive:** Grants your device the permission to receive messages from the AWS IoT message broker on any MQTT topic.
