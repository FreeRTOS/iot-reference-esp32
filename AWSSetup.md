## AWS IoT Core Setup

### Sign up for an AWS account

1. Open https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup.
2. Follow the online instructions. **NOTE:** Part of the sign-up procedure involves receiving a phone call and entering a verification code on the phone keypad. 
3. Make a note of your AWS account number as it will be needed for following steps.

### Create an Administrator IAM user and grant it permissions

Itâ€™s strongly recommended that you adhere to the best practice of using the `Administrator` IAM user that the following steps show you how to create and securely lock away the root user credentials. One should only sign in as the root user to perform a few [account and service management tasks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/root-vs-iam.html#aws_tasks-that-require-root). 

1. Sign in to the [IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/) as the account owner by choosing **Root user** and entering your AWS account email address. On the next page, enter your password.
2. On the navigation bar, click your account name, and then click Account.

5. Click **Update**.
6. Return to the [IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/).
7. In the navigation pane, choose **Users** and then choose **Add user**.

8. For **User name**, enter `Administrator`. Select the check box next to **AWS Management Console access**. Then select **Custom password**, and then enter your new password in the text box. 
9. (Optional) By default, AWS requires the new user to create a new password when first signing in. You can clear the check box next to **User must create a new password at next sign-in** to allow the new user to reset their password after they sign in.

16. Click **Next: Tags**.
17. **(Optional)** Add metadata to the user by attaching tags as key-value pairs. For more information about using tags in IAM, see [Tagging IAM entities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.
18. Click **Next: Review** to see the list of group memberships to be added to the new user. When you are ready to proceed, click **Create user**.

19. You should now see a page like the following, stating that your IAM user has been created. Click **Download .csv** in order to save your IAM credentials - store these in a safe place. These are necessary for signing into the AWS console with your newly created IAM user.

20. On the navigation bar, click your account name, and then click **Sign Out**.
21. Click **Sign In to the Console** or go to https://console.aws.amazon.com/.
22. Select **IAM user** and enter your Account ID noted earlier, then click **Next**.

![Image](getting_started_images/image12.png)

23. Enter **Administrator** in **IAM user name,** enter the **Password** set earlier for the IAM user, then click **Sign in**.

24. You are now signed in as your **Administrator** IAM user. This IAM user will be used for following steps.

### Registering your board with AWS IoT

Your board must be registered with AWS IoT to communicate with the AWS Cloud. To register your board with AWS IoT, you must have:

* **An AWS IoT policy:** An AWS IoT policy grants your device permissions to access AWS IoT resources. It is stored on the AWS Cloud.
* **An AWS IoT thing:** An AWS IoT thing allows you to manage your devices in AWS IoT. It is stored on the AWS Cloud.
* **A private key and X.509 certificate:** A private key and certificate allow your device to authenticate with AWS IoT.
* **An AWS endpoint:** An AWS endpoint is the endpoint your devices connect to.

#### Creating an AWS IoT policy

1. Go to the [AWS IoT console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iotv2/).
2. In the navigation pane, click **Secure**, then click **Policies** in the drop-down menu.

![Image](getting_started_images/image14.png)

3. Click **Create Policy**.
4. Enter a name to identify the policy. For this example, the name **DevicePolicy** will be used.

![Image](getting_started_images/image15.png)

5. Identify your **AWS region** by clicking the location dropdown menu at the top of the page to the left of the account dropdown menu. The **AWS region** is the orange text on the right. For this example, the **AWS region** will be **us-west-2**.

6. Scroll down to **Policy document** and click the **JSON** button.

![Image](getting_started_images/image17.png)

7. Inside the **Policy document**, copy and paste the following JSON into the policy editor window. Replace `aws-region` and `aws-account-id` with your AWS Region and Account ID.

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
    {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": "iot:Connect",
        "Resource":"arn:aws:iot:aws-region:aws-account-id:*"
    }, 
    {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": "iot:Publish",
        "Resource": "arn:aws:iot:aws-region:aws-account-id:*"
    },
    {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": "iot:Subscribe",
         "Resource": "arn:aws:iot:aws-region:aws-account-id:*"
    },
    {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": "iot:Receive",
         "Resource": "arn:aws:iot:aws-region:aws-account-id:*"
    }
    ]
}
```

This policy grants the following permissions:

* **iot:Connect:** Grants your device the permission to connect to the AWS IoT message broker with any client ID.
* **iot:Publish:** Grants your device the permission to publish an MQTT message on any MQTT topic.
* **iot:Subscribe:** Grants your device the permission to subscribe to any MQTT topic filter.
* **iot:Receive:** Grants your device the permission to receive messages from the AWS IoT message broker on any MQTT topic.

For more information regarding [IAM policy creation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create.html) refer to [Creating IAM policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create.html).

8. Click **Create**.

#### Creating an IoT thing, private key, and device certificate

1. Go to the [AWS IoT console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iotv2/).
2. In the navigation pane, choose **Manage**, and then choose **Things**.
