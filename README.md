# IoT Reference Integration on ESP32-C3 RISC-V MCU

## Introduction

This repo contains an ESP-IDF project that serves as a reference example for partners looking to develop a well-architected application that is designed to connect to AWS IoT Core and make use of related services in the best possible manner.  

The example shows the use of popular and important [AWS IoT LTS libraries](https://github.com/espressif/esp-aws-iot/tree/master/libraries) by means of a simple example designed to run on the ESP32-C3 which periodically publishes the temperature sensor data to AWS IoT Core and allows the WS2812 LED on the ESP32-C3 DevKit to be controlled using a JSON payload that can be published over MQTT.

This example can be used as a boilerplate to create a production-ready application.

## Features

1. Secure and Simplified provisioning: Provisioning is based on Espressif's [Unified Provisioning API](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32c3/api-reference/provisioning/provisioning.html) and can be carried out using Espressif's open source provisioning apps, available on the Google Play Store for Android, and the Apple App Store for iOS and iPadOS.  
[Google Play Store link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.espressif.provble)

```

## Set up

### Setting up your hardware and development environment

Follow the hardware and development environment setup guides given [here](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32c3/get-started/index.html).

### Setting up AWS IoT Core

#### Sign up for an AWS account

1. Open https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup.
2. Follow the online instructions. **NOTE:** Part of the sign-up procedure involves receiving a phone call and entering a verification code on the phone keypad. 
3. Make a note of your AWS account number as it will be needed for following steps.

#### Create an Administrator IAM user and grant it permissions

Itâ€™s strongly recommended that you adhere to the best practice of using the `Administrator` IAM user that the following steps show you how to create and securely lock away the root user credentials. One should only sign in as the root user to perform a few [account and service management tasks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/root-vs-iam.html#aws_tasks-that-require-root). 

1. Sign in to the [IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/) as the account owner by choosing **Root user** and entering your AWS account email address. On the next page, enter your password.
2. On the navigation bar, click your account name, and then click Account.

![Image](getting_started_images/image5.png)

8. For **User name**, enter `Administrator`. Select the check box next to **AWS Management Console access**. Then select **Custom password**, and then enter your new password in the text box. 
9. (Optional) By default, AWS requires the new user to create a new password when first signing in. You can clear the check box next to **User must create a new password at next sign-in** to allow the new user to reset their password after they sign in.

![Image](getting_started_images/image6.png)

10. Click **Next: Permissions**.
11. Click **Create group**.

![Image](getting_started_images/image7.png)

12. In the **Create group** dialog box, for **Group name** enter `Administrators`.
13. In the search box next to **Filter policies**, enter **Administrator Access.**
14. In the policy list, select the check box for **AdministratorAccess**. Then choose **Create group**.

![Image](getting_started_images/image8.png)

15. Back in the list of groups, select the check box for your new group. Choose **Refresh** if necessary to see the group in the list.

![Image](getting_started_images/image9.png)

16. Click **Next: Tags**.
17. **(Optional)** Add metadata to the user by attaching tags as key-value pairs. For more information about using tags in IAM, see [Tagging IAM entities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.
18. Click **Next: Review** to see the list of group memberships to be added to the new user. When you are ready to proceed, click **Create user**.

![Image](getting_started_images/image10.png)

19. You should now see a page like the following, stating that your IAM user has been created. Click **Download .csv** in order to save your IAM credentials - store these in a safe place. These are necessary for signing into the AWS console with your newly created IAM user.

![Image](getting_started_images/image11.png)

20. On the navigation bar, click your account name, and then click **Sign Out**.
21. Click **Sign In to the Console** or go to https://console.aws.amazon.com/.
22. Select **IAM user** and enter your Account ID noted earlier, then click **Next**.

![Image](getting_started_images/image12.png)

23. Enter **Administrator** in **IAM user name,** enter the **Password** set earlier for the IAM user, then click **Sign in**.

![Image](getting_started_images/image13.png)

24. You are now signed in as your **Administrator** IAM user. This IAM user will be used for following steps.

#### Registering your board with AWS IoT

Your board must be registered with AWS IoT to communicate with the AWS Cloud. To register your board with AWS IoT, you must have:

* **An AWS IoT policy:** An AWS IoT policy grants your device permissions to access AWS IoT resources. It is stored on the AWS Cloud.
* **An AWS IoT thing:** An AWS IoT thing allows you to manage your devices in AWS IoT. It is stored on the AWS Cloud.
* **A private key and X.509 certificate:** A private key and certificate allow your device to authenticate with AWS IoT.
* **An AWS endpoint:** An AWS endpoint is the endpoint your devices connect to.

##### Creating an AWS IoT policy

1. Go to the [AWS IoT console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iotv2/).
2. In the navigation pane, click **Secure**, then click **Policies** in the drop-down menu.

![Image](getting_started_images/image14.png)

3. Click **Create Policy**.
4. Enter a name to identify the policy. For this example, the name **DevicePolicy** will be used.

![Image](getting_started_images/image15.png)

5. Identify your **AWS region** by clicking the location dropdown menu at the top of the page to the left of the account dropdown menu. The **AWS region** is the orange text on the right. For this example, the **AWS region** will be **us-west-2**.

![Image](getting_started_images/image16.png)

6. Scroll down to **Policy document** and click the **JSON** button.

![Image](getting_started_images/image17.png)

7. Inside the **Policy document**, copy and paste the following JSON into the policy editor window. Replace `aws-region` and `aws-account-id` with your AWS Region and Account ID.

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
    {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": "iot:Connect",
        "Resource":"arn:aws:iot:aws-region:aws-account-id:*"
    }, 
    {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": "iot:Publish",
        "Resource": "arn:aws:iot:aws-region:aws-account-id:*"
    },
    {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": "iot:Subscribe",
         "Resource": "arn:aws:iot:aws-region:aws-account-id:*"
    },
    {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": "iot:Receive",
         "Resource": "arn:aws:iot:aws-region:aws-account-id:*"
    }
    ]
}
```

![Image](getting_started_images/image18.png)

This policy grants the following permissions:

* **iot:Connect:** Grants your device the permission to connect to the AWS IoT message broker with any client ID.
* **iot:Publish:** Grants your device the permission to publish an MQTT message on any MQTT topic.
* **iot:Subscribe:** Grants your device the permission to subscribe to any MQTT topic filter.
* **iot:Receive:** Grants your device the permission to receive messages from the AWS IoT message broker on any MQTT topic.

For more information regarding [IAM policy creation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create.html) refer to [Creating IAM policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create.html).

8. Click **Create**.

##### Creating an IoT thing, private key, and device certificate

1. Go to the [AWS IoT console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iotv2/).
2. In the navigation pane, choose **Manage**, and then choose **Things**.

![Image](getting_started_images/image19.png)

3. Click **Create things.**

![Image](getting_started_images/image20.png)

4. Select **Create a single thing** then click **Next**.

![Image](getting_started_images/image21.png)

5. Enter a name for your thing, and then click **Next**. For this example, the thing name will be **ExampleThing**.

![Image](getting_started_images/image22.png)

6. Select **Auto-generate a new certificate**, then click **Next**.

![Image](getting_started_images/image23.png)

7. Attach the policy you created above by searching for it and clicking the checkbox next to it, then click **Create thing**. **NOTE:** Multiple policies can be attached to a thing.

![Image](getting_started_images/image24.png)

8. Download your private key, public key, and device certificate by choosing the **Download** links for each. These will be used by your device to connect to AWS IoT Core. **NOTE:** The private key and public key can only be downloaded here, so store them in a safe place.

![Image](getting_started_images/image25.png)

##### Obtaining your AWS endpoint

1. Go to [AWS IoT console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iotv2/).
2. In the navigation pane, click **Settings**.

![Image](getting_started_images/image26.png)

3. Your **AWS endpoint** is under **Device data endpoint**. Note this endpoint as it will be used later when setting up your board.

![Image](getting_started_images/image27.png)

### Provisioning credentials to device

If you followed the Setting up AWS IoT Core steps, as part of creating a thing, you downloaded a Private Key (`xxx-private.pem.key`) and a Certificate file (`xxx-certificate.pem.crt`). You also should have taken note of the device endpoint for your AWS account. These credentials need to be loaded onto the device so it can be identified by AWS IoT Core.

This project provides support for two options for provisioning device credentials required for device identity:  

1. Hardcoding credentials directly into the binary.
2. Using the [Digital Signature Peripheral](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32c3/api-reference/peripherals/ds.html).

While use of the [Digital Signature Peripheral](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32c3/api-reference/peripherals/ds.html) is the recommended and most secure way for handling device credentials in a production environment, the default developer-friendly workflow is the use of hardcoded certificates.

#### Option 1 - Non-secure method - Hardcoding credentials directly into the binary

### Configuring demos

This repository currently supports 3 demos implemented as FreeRTOS tasks, each of which utilize the same MQTT connection managed by the coreMQTT-Agent library for thread-safety. The demos are the following:
* **Over-The-Air update demo:** This demo has the user create an OTA job on AWS IoT for their device and watch as it downloads the updated firmware, and reboot with the updated firmware.
* **SubPubUnsub demo:** This demo creates tasks which Subscribe to a topic on AWS IoT Core, Publish to the same topic, receive their own publish since the device is subscribed to the topic it published to, then Unsubscribe from the topic in a loop.
* **TempPubSub and LED control demo:** This demo utilizes the temperature sensor to send temperature readings to IoT Core, and allows the user to send JSON payloads back to the device to control it's LED.

By default, all 3 demos are enabled and will run concurrently with each other.

To configure the demos:

1. Open the ESP-IDF menuconfig.
    1. **Terminal/Command Prompt users**
        1. Open the ESP-IDF Terminal/Command Prompt
        2. Set the directory to the root of this project.

2. This example supports multiple ways to securely store the PKI credentials.
The default method is to use PKI credentials which are embedded in the binary, using the certs from the `certs/` directory. 
3. Run `idf.py build flash monitor -p <UART port>` to build, flash and start the serial console.
4. Subscribe to the `/filter/Publisher0` topic and check if you are getting JSON messages as follows:
```json
{
  "temperatureSensor": {
    "taskName": "Publisher0",
    "temperatureValue": 36.064602,
    "iteration": 1
  }
}
```
5. To change the LED power state, publish the following JSON payload on the same `/filter/Publisher0` topic:
```json
{
    "led":
    {
        "power": 1
    }
}
```

## Security
1. Steps to enable Flash Encryption on ESP32-C3 can be found [here](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32c3/security/flash-encryption.html).
2. Steps to enable Secure Boot on ESP32-C3 can be found [here](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32c3/security/secure-boot-v2.html).
3. The Digital Signature Peripheral on the ESP32-C3 can operate on encrypted private key directly, restricting software access to device identity.  
The DS Peripheral can be provisioned using the `configure_ds.py` script available in the `components/esp_secure_cert_mgr/tools/` directory and following the steps listed in the `README.md` in the same directory.  
Once you have configured the DS Peripheral and verified it by running the `components/esp_secure_cert_mgr/esp_secure_cert_app` application, simply choose the `Use DS peripheral` option in `idf.py menuconfig`.

## Debugging
Follow the debugging guide of the ESP32-C3 given [here](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32c3/api-guides/jtag-debugging/index.html).

## Troubleshooting
* If you are not able to establish USB serial connection, you will need to download the drivers and check the additional information for your operating system in the [Establish Serial Connection](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32c3/get-started/establish-serial-connection.html) guide.

* Raise the ESP debug log level to Debug in order to see messages about the connection to AWS, certificate contents, etc.

* Enable mbedTLS debugging (under Components -> mbedTLS -> mbedTLS Debug) in order to see even more low-level debug output from the mbedTLS layer.

* To create a successful AWS IoT connection, the following factors must all be present:
  - Endpoint hostname is correct for your AWS account.
  - Certificate & private key are both attached to correct Thing in AWS IoT Console.
  - Certificate is activated.
  - Policy is attached to the Certificate in AWS IoT Console.
  - Policy contains sufficient permissions to authorize AWS IoT connection.

* If your TLS connection fails entirely

If connecting fails entirely (handshake doesn't complete), this usually indicates a problem with certification configuration. The error usually looks like this:

```
failed! mbedtls_ssl_handshake returned -0x7780
```

(0x7780 is the mbedTLS error code when the server sends an alert message and closes the connection.)

* Check your client private key and certificate file match a Certificate registered and **activated** in AWS IoT console. You can find the Certificate in IoT Console in one of two ways, via the Thing or via Certificates:
  - To find the Certificate directly, click on "Registry" -> "Security Certificates". Then click on the Certificate itself to view it.
  - To find the Certificate via the Thing, click on "Registry" -> "Things", then click on the particular Thing you are using. Click "Certificates" in the sidebar to view all Certificates attached to that Thing. Then click on the Certificate itself to view it.

Verify the Certificate is activated (when viewing the Certificate, it will say "ACTIVE" or "INACTIVE" near the top under the certificate name).

If the Certificate appears correct and activated, verify that you are connecting to the correct AWS IoT endpoint (see above.)

* If your TLS connection closes immediately

Sometimes connecting is successful (the handshake completes) but as soon as the client sends its `MQTT CONNECT` message the server sends back a TLS alert and closes the connection, without anything else happening.

The error returned from AWS IoT is usually -28 (`MQTT_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_ERROR`). You may also see mbedtls error `-0x7780` (server alert), although if this error comes during `mbedtls_ssl_handshake` then it's usually a different problem (see above).

This error implies the Certificate is recognised, but the Certificate is either missing the correct Thing or the correct Policy attached to it.

* Check in the AWS IoT console that your certificate is activated and has both a **security policy** and a **Thing** attached to it. You can find this in IoT Console by clicking "Registry" -> "Security Certificates", then click the Certificate. Once viewing the Certificate, you can click the "Policies" and "Things" links in the sidebar.
